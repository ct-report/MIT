Contact Tracing - MIT PrivateKit:SafePaths

Solution **PrivateKit:SafePaths** developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology & partners. It relies on location tracing + Bluetooth to check crossed paths with other users of such app. 

It relies on a decentralized model. Location logs & interaction history generated by PrivateKit remain inside the userâ€™s device. Data transfer occurs only if the user chooses to share it with a trusted researcher / health official.

There is also another version - **COVID Safe Paths** - that has been published on Google Play Store by a non-profit partner (Path Checks Inc.). It doesn't support Bluetooth proximity tracing / interaction history. It relies only in location trail matching with risk-area heatmaps provided by Health Authorities.
